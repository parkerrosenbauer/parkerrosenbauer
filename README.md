- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @parkerrosenbauer

I bring a solid professional background in data services and retail management to the table. In my current role, I'm focused on the nuts and bolts of data processing, alongside the upkeep of existing automated systems and the development of new ones as needed. This involves leveraging tools like MS 365 applications and Python.

Outside the professional realm, I enjoy applying my skills to practical projects that enrich my personal life. This includes creating monthly budget reports tailored for myself and my family, as well as building programs aimed at optimizing resource management within video games.
