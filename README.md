- 👋 Hi, I’m @parkerrosenbauer

My name is Parker, I'm 24 years old, and I live in Menomonie, WI. My professional background includes experience in retail and property management. I have overseen teams large and small while keeping track of performance metrics. This is where I found my love for data analytics. I found a lot of joy in working through my team's data, finding what we did well and how we could improve, and then brainstorming and implementing solutions. In order to pursue data science and analytics as a career, I enrolled in QuickStart's Bootcamp, hosted by Northeastern Illinois University. In the Bootcamp, I not only have the opportunity to learn how to collect, clean, analyze, and interpret data, but I get to work with a mentor who is in the field as well as classmates who are going through similar experiences as myself.
