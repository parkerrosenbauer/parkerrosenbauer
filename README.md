- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @parkerrosenbauer

My interest in data analysis really started while working for a large retail chain and tracking my metrics with tableau. I could have spent all day studying these, figuring out why the data was the way it was, and planning to improve the metrics if my bosses would have let me. After leaving this job, I knew I wanted to do something more with my career, but didn't know what. Finding out about Google's professional certificates, I looked into them more and saw the data analytics course. This rekindled my interests in looking over the data and using (or even creating!) powerful visualizations. After starting the course, I knew to switch careers to my now dream job of data analyst would take more than this one certificate, and since then I have enrolled in a data science bootcamp to help me gain all the skills I'll need to be a data analyst.
